# UFOs
<br>
<h2> Overview of Project</h2>
<br>The purpose of this analysis was to provide the data on all UFO sightings in an easy to explore way. This way any user can input different search crtieria and instantly get the relevant data points.<br>
<h2> Results: </h2>
<br>Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation. A user can now type any date, city, state, country, or shape and get all of the matching data. <br>
Here is an example of inputting a shape into the search criteria:<br>

<h2> Summary: </h2>
<br>While this works much better than the previous version of the site, there are still some challenges. To further improve the site, we could add a way to accept incorrect or alternate spellings in the search table to make the user experience easier.
